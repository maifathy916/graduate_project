'Tooth decay'=>'Tooth decay is parts of teeth with rot that may progress to
               small or large holes gradually.

           Tooth decay is one of the most common health
problems around the world. It is widespread, mainly, among children
and adolescents, but every person in his mouth has teeth that may develop
cavities. And if tooth decay is not treated, the holes may get bigger and wider
, causing severe pain, inflammation,
and even tooth loss and other complications.
Cleaning (rubbing) the teeth after eating or drinking

Mouth rinse
Visit a dentist regularly
Checking the possibility of tightening gaps between teeth
Drinking water from taps (faucets)
Refrain as much as possible from eating snacks and sweetened drinks
Eat foods that strengthen dental health
Fluoride treatment
  Use antibacterial agents, if necessary',
'Scaling'=>'Scaling',
'Dental scaling'=>'Dental scaling is routinely performed to help patients with gum
disease and excessive plaque buildup. While a standard cleaning
will address the surface of the tooth, scaling goes much deeper.
If your dentist suggests dental scaling and root planing for your teeth,
it’s helpful to know what this means so you can prepare for what’s ahead.
Understanding Scaling
Scaling is a common dental procedure for patients
with gum disease. This is a type of dental cleaning that
reaches below the gumline to remove plaque buildup.
The process of scaling and root planing the teeth is often referred
to as a deep cleaning. This treatment goes beyond the general cleaning
that you receive with your regular checkup and annual visit.',
'Root Canal Treatment'=>'Root Canal Treatment',
'root canal'=>"
A root canal is a treatment used to repair and save a tooth
that is badly decayed or becomes infected. During a root canal
procedure, the nerve and pulp are removed and the inside of the
tooth is cleaned and sealed. Without treatment, the tissue surrounding
the tooth will become infected and abscesses may form.
'Root canal' is the term used to describe the natural cavity
within the center of the tooth. The pulp or pulp chamber is the soft
area within the root canal. The tooth's nerve lies within the root canal.",
'Dentures'=>'Dentures',
'denture '=>'    A denture is a removable replacement for missing
teeth and surrounding tissues. Two types of dentures are
available -- complete and partial dentures. Complete dentures
are used when all the teeth are missing, while partial dentures
are used when some natural teeth remain.
Complete Dentures
Complete dentures can be either "conventional" or "immediate."
Made after the teeth have been removed and the gum tissue has begun
to heal, a conventional denture is ready for placement in the mouth
about eight to 12 weeks after the teeth have been removed.',
'filling'=>' A filling is a way to restore a tooth damaged by decay back to its
normal function and shape. When a dentist gives you a filling, he
or she first removes the decayed tooth material, cleans the affected
area, and then fills the cleaned out cavity with a filling material.
By closing off spaces where bacteria can enter, a filling also helps
prevent further decay. Materials used for fillings include gold,
porcelain, a composite resin (tooth-colored fillings), and an amalgam
(an alloy of mercury, silver, copper, tin and sometimes zinc).',
